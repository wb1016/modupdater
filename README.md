# ARCHIVED
original mod *modupdater* is not needed now 
since all mods used to dependent to it removed dependency and dropped support.
this mod does nothing when its used, making it comepletely useless.\
use [fabrilous updater](https://github.com/HughBone/fabrilous-updater) instead.

# ModUpdater for snapshot

bad fork of fabric modupdater for satisfy dependency.
not for actual operation. just for dependency to launch related mods without removing update function.
there might be some bugs.
